			The book contains sufficient material for at least a full year of study, but we expect many people to use it for only a single-term course. In such a single-term course,students learn to identify the types of problems that require numerical techniques for their solution and see examples of the error propagation that can occur when numerical methods are applied.They accurately approximate the solution of problems that cannot be solved exactly and learn typical techniques for estimating error bounds for the approximations. The remainder of the text then serves as a reference for methods not considered in the course. Either the full-year or single-course treatment is consistent with the philosophy of the text.The book contains sufficient material for at least a full year of study, but we expect many people to use it for only a single-term course.
